# HonorsCSIntro_17-18
This repository contains all of my projects from my Intro to Computer Science class from the 9th grade, 2017-2018. It covered all the basics of programming, using C++, covering topics all the way through an intro to Object Oriented Programming, dealing with structs and basic classes.
